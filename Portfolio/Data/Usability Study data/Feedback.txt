Presentation feedback notes
- send survey to prof?
- mute button
- personalization with membership card (no receipst etc)
- +/- buttons for bags (no one is inputting 100)
- language/mute options visible on all screens
- bag selection screen too cluttered (back button inside pop-up)
- bag selection should start with a yes/no prompt
- back button + discard session too redundant?
- remove item list from payment screen (maybe only display total)
- annotate photos of existing systems
- design interactive UI

After Usability testing Notes

some feedback we got for our prototype:
- remove bag prompt, just show selection with default 0 bags
- prompt to remove the item after removing it
- start screen should have a bigger font option (a11y)
- speaker icon should have a label for clarity
- add membership card support

- buyer shouldn’t be allowed to remove items
- bag selection confirmation button at the bottom
- add coupon support

and from the professor:
- bottom row of buttons (discard, call assistant, continue) need icons next to text 
  > Discard icon: X
  > Continue icon: checkmark
  > Call assistant icon: phone icon maybe?
- scan item action bound to a hotkey instead of a big green button cluttering the prototype UI
  > display which item was scanned in that position to fill the space and let the buyer double check the price
- payment screen is great
- overall prototype UI is good
- bag icon doesn’t look like a bag
- bag prompt is good
  > maybe default to number selection with "no bag" button (bag icon crossed out)
- add payment flow screen to the prototype


- on the payment screen it could show discounts and ddv for the price
- option to make the volume lower or higher (not just turning it on or off)
- someone asked why we need a button on the start screen to start scanning (so I think we should definitely allow the users to start scanning without even clicking the button first)
- accessibility features for people with dissabilities (someone said that apparently they are very happy if you include stuff like that)


After Mid Presentation
do not group functionally different buttons in the bottom row (maybe move the call assistant button next to language flags)
bag selection screen should move the continue button to be consistent with other views
discard session button should be move elsewhere
improve design
